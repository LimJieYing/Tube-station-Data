A simple procedural program to record the details of up to 100 underground stations. 
The program should first repeatedly ask the user to input the names of the stations and whether it has step free access. 
After the details of a station have been entered, the user should be asked if they wish to stop and the details of a station cannot be changed once set.

Once all these details have been entered, the program should then go into a new loop that offers three choices:
1. end the program.
2. print whether a given station has step free access, given
the station name.
3. print details of all stations with step free access.
